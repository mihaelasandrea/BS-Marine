                            <p> 
                                Bogdan Sandrea started his sea life in 1992, as a deck cadet, and disembarked from his last vessel as a master in 2010.
                                After he gained his chief officer ticket, in 1999, he continued working in that rank for approximately 10 years on vessels 
                                ranging from MR (the 35 kT’s from Maersk, a.k.a. the “R” class) up to VLCC size (the Saudi Arabian 300 kT’s). 
                                 He had worked for various companies, thus gaining a priceless experience in dealing with different work environments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Between 2000-2001, while he was employed by an Owner-Operator, he spent three months each year in preparing the Employer’s
                                SIRE approach system, the result being at the customer’s satisfaction. He left the tanker world in 2005 for only a couple
                                of months in order to sail as master on a freight ferry in the busy English Channel (Radicatel – near Port Jerome – to 
                                Southampton twice a day).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 After gaining ship handling experience he returned to tankers on Aframax size ships – also short 
                                trips on one fitted with a bow thruster, carrying exclusively high hydrogen sulphide Mexican crude to USA. The two years
                                described above provided him the experience of short trips (the shortest pilot to pilot sea time was 6 hours and the longest 42 hours)
                                in two different parts of the world and also the understanding of the associated risks. He had never been involved in any kind of 
                                incident or accident but had been part of internal investigation committees a couple of occasions where he looked at reasons 
                                behind pollution incidents involving tankers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 He quit the sea life in 2010, due to family commitments, and became a SIRE inspector,
                                 being sponsored by an oil major. He voluntarily receives trainings on a regular basis, 
                                 covering several areas of interest in the industry, staying up-to-date with the latest requirements and future regulations as well.

                            BS Marine was founded in 2010 in Rotterdam, the European shipping business centre, chosen due to its ideal location, between
                                 Amsterdam and Antwerp - the website was launched to celebrate 10 years of its existence. Over a hundred vessels are attended each year,
                                most of them tankers, but also PCTC’s (pure car and truck carriers), general cargo, heavy lift, etc. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                BS Marine covers successfully
                                the ARA region (Amsterdam – Rotterdam – Antwerp) for various customers performing various works, ranging from SIRE and BIRE inspections,
                                flag state inspections and audits and ending with STS assessments and investigations.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p> BS Marine is completely honest and impartial,
                                 being totally committed to the SIRE inspection programme, guided by its OCIMF Inspector Code of Ethics.
